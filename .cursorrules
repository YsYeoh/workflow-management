## Project Documentation Reference

**CRITICAL**: Always refer to and follow the project documentation:

- **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Contains the complete system architecture, design decisions, technology stack, database schema, multi-tenancy strategy, workflow engine design, API specifications, and all technical context. ALWAYS consult this file before making architectural decisions or implementing features.

- **TODO.md** - Contains the comprehensive task breakdown for the entire project. Use this file to:
  - Understand what needs to be implemented
  - Track progress and identify dependencies
  - Ensure all required features are covered
  - Reference specific task requirements when implementing features

**Rules for using project documentation**:
- Before starting any implementation, read relevant sections from PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Check TODO.md to understand the full scope of related tasks
- Follow the architecture patterns, naming conventions, and design decisions specified in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Ensure implementations align with the database schema and API design documented in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- When implementing features, mark completed tasks in TODO.md or reference them in your responses

- Follow user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write the code!
- Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO Todo's, placeholders and missing pieces.
- Be sure to reference filenames.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you don't know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
